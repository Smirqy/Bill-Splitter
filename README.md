# About:
This project contains both a Group Tab Calculator and Bill Splitting Calculator. The group tab calculator allows people to add what they paid and then shows the charge that should be made to the others in the group. The Bill Splitting Calculator divides up the items on a receipt allowing people to pay for part of an item's cost or not.

# Reason:
Found that apps in this area are not intutive or can be difficult to use so coding my own allowed me to customize how I wanted the information to be displayed.
